# Echo-MS Detection of Molecules from an Enzymatic Reaction (Cell Free)

**URL:** https://cloud.ginkgo.bio/protocols/echo-ms-cfps-detection
**Status:** Beta
**Price:** $44/sample
**Turnaround:** up to 13 days

## Overview

Fastest path from a protein sequence to a functional, quantitative readout on enzyme activity. Using a proprietary reconstituted E. coli transcription-translation (CFPS) system, Ginkgo expresses your enzyme of interest in 4-16 hours. A substrate or product is then added directly to the well and substrate conversion is measured by acoustic ejection mass spectrometry (Echo-MS), delivering a go/no-go signal without protein purification. Enzyme expression and Echo-MS are performed using the baseline Cell Free Protein Synthesis Master Mix.

To run this protocol, the relevant analyte/method must first be onboarded (see [echo-ms-method-onboarding.md](echo-ms-method-onboarding.md)).

## Input
