# Ginkgo Cloud Lab

## Overview

Ginkgo Cloud Lab (https://cloud.ginkgo.bio) provides remote access to Ginkgo Bioworks' autonomous lab infrastructure. Protocols are executed on Reconfigurable Automation Carts (RACs) -- modular units with robotic arms, maglev sample transport, and industrial-grade software spanning 70+ instruments.

The platform also includes **EstiMate**, an AI agent that accepts human-language protocol descriptions and returns feasibility assessments and pricing for custom workflows beyond the listed protocols.

The catalog is organized into **Expression & Purification** (in vitro / cell-free / E. coli / Pichia), **Characterization & Assay**, **Method & Target Onboarding**, and **Specialty**. Pick a protocol below, then read its reference file for inputs, outputs, the automated workflow, and ordering details.

**Coming soon:** Protein Expression and Binding Affinity Characterization (express + purify, then screen binding affinity against a target).

## Choosing a Protocol

- **Quick expressibility screen?** Cell-free HiBiT ($39) or Validate sequence expression ($39).
- **Need purified protein + yield?** A280 tiers (cell-free or E. coli); add LabChip for purity/size.
- **Difficult / membrane / disulfide / cofactor targets?** Cell-free Optimize (24-condition DoE).
- **Secreted or eukaryotic targets?** Pichia expression.
- **Screening de novo binders/minibinders?** Cell-free or E. coli minibinder tiers, then SPR onboarding for kinetics.
- **Enzyme activity / biocatalysis?** Echo-MS enzymatic detection (onboard the analyte method first).
- **Stability / developability ranking?** Thermal shift assay.
- **RNA (mRNA/circRNA)?** IVT synthesis + qPCR.

## General Ordering Workflow

1. Select a protocol at https://cloud.ginkgo.bio/protocols
2. Configure parameters (number of proteins/samples/molecules/targets, replicates, plates)
3. Download the protocol's input template and upload inputs (FASTA/CSV/XLSX for sequence protocols; Design Tool for pixel art; vendor catalog numbers for onboarding)
4. Add any special requirements in the Additional Details field
5. Provide an email, agree to the protocol terms, and add to cart / submit to receive a feasibility report and price quote

For protocols not listed above, use the **EstiMate** chat (https://cloud.ginkgo.bio/estimate) to describe a custom protocol in plain language and receive a compatibility assessment and pricing.
